# Clearview Front-End Technical Assessment

You're going to create a user interface for an organization admin of a forum,
here are the requirements:
- As an admin, I should be see all of the organization's comments/posts
- As an admin, I should be able to delete an organization's comments/posts
- As an admin, I should be able to post a comment on behalf of my organization
- As an admin, I should be able to pull all the members of an organization

You are to create pages to reflect the user stories described above, and you must use the backend service provided
in the `/server` in order to interact with the data provided. See API documentation in the `server` directory.

## Development

**Start the backend service with docker:**

In the `/server` directory, run:
```bash
# run in `detached` mode (recommended):
docker-compose up -d

# Or run attached, you will see both container logs: mongodb init log and running server log
docker-compose up

# to stop containers generated by docker-compose, run:
docker-compose down
```
**Docker compose** will pull & build both the project and the **mongodb** image from docker hub. After *compose* has successfully built the images,
go to http://localhost:1337 to verify that the container is running.

## Technical Requirements
- Please use React / Vue
- To keep design / styling to a minimal, please use [ant.design](https://ant.design) for react and [https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/](https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) for vue.

Bonus points, if you use:
- State management (vuex, redux, zustand, mobx, etc.)
- Incorporate tests (business logic or otherwise)
- Incorporate UI testing
- Use functional programming paradigms
- Strongly typed Typescript
